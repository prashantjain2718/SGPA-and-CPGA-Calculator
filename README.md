## ⚙️ Installation & Local Setup

If you want to run this locally or contribute:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/prashantjain2718/rtu-cgpa-calculator.git](https://github.com/prashantjain2718/rtu-cgpa-calculator.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd rtu-cgpa-calculator
    ```

3.  **Open the file**
    Simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser. No `npm` or local server is strictly required.

## 📖 How It Works

### 1. The Formula
The calculator uses the official RTU formulas:

* **SGPA** = $\frac{\sum(Credit \times GradePoint)}{\sum(TotalCredits)}$
* **CGPA** = $\frac{(PrevCGPA \times PrevCredits) + (CurrSGPA \times CurrCredits)}{TotalCredits}$

### 2. Grading Scale
| Grade | Points | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **A++** | 10 | Outstanding |
| **A+** | 9 | Excellent |
| **A** | 8.5 | Very Good |
| **B+** | 8 | Good |
| **B** | 7.5 | Above Average |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **F** | 0 | Fail |
